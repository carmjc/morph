The player can use patterns to avoid designing very big units by hand every time.\r\n* Units can be IA assembled and IA driven on the battlefield, IA can be programmed by the player.\r\n\r\n### Project state\r\nA basic engine is available to see the general idea of the project.\r\nYou can fork the project or inject ideas as issues in the issue database."}
